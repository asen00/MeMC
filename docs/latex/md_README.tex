The Me\+MC is an open-\/source software package for monte-\/carlo simulation of elastic shells. The package can be useful to study the mechanics of biological nano-\/vesicles e.\+g. Exosomes.

Micro and nano vesicles play a crucial role in biology and medicine. The physical properties of these vesicles play an important role in their biological functions. Hence it is important to measure their elastic constants. One of the ways, to measure elastic constants of cells, is to poke them with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) tip to compute force-\/distance curve. Then the cell is modeled as a linear elastic material and by fitting this model to the experimental force-\/distance curve, the parameters of elastic model i.\+e. cell is estimated. However nano-\/vesicles differ from cells in two ways\+:

1) The nano-\/vesicles are much smaller hence thermal fluctuations may effectively renormalize the elastic coefficients. (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011002}{\texttt{ Ko≈°mrlj \& Nelson, 2017}}, \href{https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1212268109}{\texttt{ Paulose et al., 2012}}). 2) Cell membranes are strongly coupled to an underlying cytoskelton. Hence they may be modeled by a solid body (\href{https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.202617299}{\texttt{ HW et al., 2002}}) but nano-\/vesicles must be modeled as liquid filled elastic membranes.

Hence, to be able to interpret the force-\/distance curve of nano-\/vesicles, we need to solve for the elastic response of thermally fluctuating elastic shell.

There are commercial packages, e.\+g. \href{www.comsol.com}{\texttt{ COMSOL}}, to calculate the force-\/distance curve of solid bodies and closed membranes, but there are no package that include the thermal effects. The goal of this package is to bridge that gap.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Prerequisites}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
Me\+MC requires following libraries\+:

1) A C++ compiler. We have tested the code against gnu \href{https://gcc.gnu.org/}{\texttt{ g++}} versions 5.\+4.\+0 and above on x86\+\_\+64 CPU.

2) \href{https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5}{\texttt{ Hdf5}} libraries for reading and writing data. ~\newline


3) \href{https://www.python.org/}{\texttt{ Python}} version with \href{https://www.scipy.org}{\texttt{ scipy}}, \href{https://www.numpy.org}{\texttt{ numpy}}, \href{https://www.h5py.org}{\texttt{ h5py}} and \href{https://https://pypi.org/project/numpy-quaternion/}{\texttt{ numpy-\/quartenion}} installed. We have tested the code against python version 3.\+8 and above.

For details of the installation for different packages, check the instructions on the official web page of the packages. If the operating system is Ubuntu then, g++ and hdf5 can be installed using the package manager apt,


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{apt install g++ libhdf5-\/dev}

\end{DoxyCode}
 The environment variables for include and library path may not be set properly after the installation. In such a scenario, the user should set these paths manually in the Makefile to compile the package.

In order to install the required python libraries we suggest using the standard python package manager pip, 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip install scipy numpy-\/quaternion h5py}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
Once the prerequisites are satisfied, the installation of the Me\+MC amounts executing the following bash commands\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/vipinagrawal25/MeMC}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd MeMC}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}

\end{DoxyCode}
 If successful, one should find an extra {\ttfamily bin} directory in the folder. The bin directory will contain the binaries {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+start} and {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+memc}.

\DoxyHorRuler{0}
 {\bfseries{NOTE}} If the installation fails and shows the error


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{In file included from hdf5.h:22:0,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                 from src/hdf5\_io.cpp:1:}
\DoxyCodeLine{H5public.h:68:17: fatal error: mpi.h: No such file or directory}
\DoxyCodeLine{compilation terminated.}

\end{DoxyCode}
 then we suggest the user to compile the code as\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make CC=/path/to/h5c++.}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Using the Package\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
The package is built to understand the physics of Exosomes or viruses where the thermal noise are relevant. These nano-\/vesicles are studied experimentally using Atomic Force Microscopy. This package tends to simulate the experiment in the best possible way. Therefore, we expect the user to have a prior understanding of the Metropolis algorithm for the Monte Carlo simulation and a basic concept of Elasticity pertaining to membranes. Both the concept is described in detail in the document {\ttfamily paper/paper.\+pdf}. That being said, we shall now dive deeper and explain how different part of the code functions in the following sections\+:\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Constructing the membrane}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
To begin the simulation we generate a equilibrated randomized position on a surface of a sphere. For details we refer the reader to {\ttfamily subsection grid} in {\ttfamily section numerical implementation} of {\ttfamily paper/paper.\+pdf}. The main code for this purpose is given in {\ttfamily main/start.\+cpp} and the relevant executable is {\ttfamily bin/exe\+\_\+start}. The executable takes three arguments\+: 1) Number of random points to be equilibrated 2) Geometry of the surface {\ttfamily sph} for a surface of sphere and {\ttfamily cart} for flat plane 3) Folder name inside which the outputs will be written. 4) Number of monte-\/carlo steps

Rest of the parameter are hard coded. For instance, the radius of the sphere on which we generate randomize positions is unity.

In order to generate a randomized configuration of 1024 points in surface of sphere with radius one, the user can execute


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./bin/exe\_start 1024 sph data\_sph 60000}

\end{DoxyCode}
 All the outputs will be dumped inside {\ttfamily data\+\_\+sph}.

\DoxyHorRuler{0}
 {\bfseries{NOTE}}

The simulation will run for 60000 Monte Carlo steps, which will take more than 2 hours to complete. To proceed with the other sections it is sufficient to kill the simulation after 1000 Monte Carlo steps. The user can give smaller steps as well.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Triangulating the surface}\label{md_README_autotoc_md7}
The surface of the membrane will respond to all the internal and external forces present. The internal ones are due to bending or stretching. If the user has read the {\ttfamily subsection energy} in {\ttfamily section numerical implementation} of the document, then evaluation of these forces requires the knowledge of all the neighbours of a point. For this purpose we rely on the python wrapper for \href{qhull.org}{\texttt{ qhull}}, known as Convex\+Hull. We provide a utility script, {\ttfamily utils/gen\+\_\+memc\+\_\+conf.\+py} which takes the output from the {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+start}, set all the connections and write the output as {\ttfamily conf/dmemc\+\_\+conf.\+h5}. Additionally the positions of the particle is written in {\ttfamily conf/dmemc\+\_\+pos.\+h5}. The user can copy paste the following command to set the connection for dump {\ttfamily data\+\_\+sph/snap\+\_\+0003.\+h5}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{python utils/gen\_memc\_conf.py data\_sph/snap\_0003.h5.}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Me\+MC}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}
Once the connections are set, the executable {\ttfamily bin/exe\+\_\+memc} can be used to numerically study the nano-\/vesicles. The binary takes two arguments\+: 1) Name of the parameter file from which all the physical parameters is read. 2) The folder name to store all the data.

The para file is not a format-\/free input. The variables has to be in the specified format to be read correctly. We urge the user to copy the following block and paste them identically to a plain text file for input.

 {\bfseries{NOTE}} The radius can be kept unity and all the parameters are scaled accordingly. For example, to study the effect of 10nm AFM tip over a 100nm exosome, one should take radius 1 and tip\+\_\+radius = 1/20.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Example}\label{md_README_autotoc_md9}
An example shell script with proper calls to the binaries and utilities functions can be found inside folder {\ttfamily Examples}. The script is named {\ttfamily execute.\+sh}. Change the directory to Examples in terminal and paste the following for execution.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sh execute.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}


The code takes about 30 minutes on Intel(\+R) Core(\+TM) i5-\/8265U CPU. Once completed, the results can be verified against the simulation we have conducted. Use the \href{https://www.gnuplot.org}{\texttt{ Gnuplot}} script {\ttfamily plot.\+gnu}, which compares the histogram of total energies written by {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+start} and {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+memc} to the histogram for the same ({\ttfamily hist\+\_\+start.\+dat} and {\ttfamily hist\+\_\+memc.\+dat}) we had evaluated. The following command should do the trick. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gnuplot plot.gnu}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Two plot windows similar to A and B should open. In both the figures, the continuous line is the result from the simulation conducted locally.

{\bfseries{NOTE}} In case the plot script fails to generate the plot, the main reason could be lack of \href{https://www.gsl.org}{\texttt{ gsl-\/histogram}} in your local machine. We suggest to use numpy or other standard libraries for the same purpose. We have omitted top 6000 data points while generating the histogram. \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{Data Structure}\label{md_README_autotoc_md10}
Both the binaries {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+start} and {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+memc} outputs the percentage of accepted moves in the second column and total energy in the third column of the configuration of {\ttfamily mc\+\_\+log}. In the first column, we write the iteration of Monte Carlo. In {\ttfamily mc\+\_\+log} file written by {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+memc}, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and the eighth column respectively stores the energy due to {\bfseries{stretching,bending, sticking, the afm contribution and the volume}}.

Apart from the {\ttfamily mc\+\_\+log} snapshot of the positions constituting the membrane are dumped every {\ttfamily mc\+\_\+dump\+\_\+iter} step in the para file. We use Hierarchical Data Format or the HDF5 library. In both the case, we write the positions in {\ttfamily snap\+\_\+xx.\+h5} series, where {\ttfamily xx} represents Monte Carlo iterations divide by {\ttfamily mc\+\_\+dump\+\_\+iter}.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{Visualization}\label{md_README_autotoc_md11}
Visualization of membrane can be done using \href{https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/index.html}{\texttt{ visit}} or \href{https://www.paraview.org}{\texttt{ paraview}}. We provide a python utility to convert the hdf5 file to vtk format, {\ttfamily utils/viz\+\_\+memc.\+py}. The program takes three arguments\+: 1) Snapshot from the {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+memc} 2) The file with connections, or {\ttfamily conf/dmemc\+\_\+conf.\+h5} 3) Name of the output file with extension {\ttfamily .vtk} which will be read from Visit.

The user can paste the following in the terminal 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{python utils/viz\_memc.py out\_memc/snap\_0000.h5 conf/dmemc\_conf.h5 viz\_000.vtk }
\DoxyCodeLine{python utils/viz\_memc.py out\_memc/snap\_0010.h5 conf/dmemc\_conf.h5 viz\_010.vtk}

\end{DoxyCode}


If the execution is successful, the file {\ttfamily viz\+\_\+000.\+vtk} and {\ttfamily viz\+\_\+010.\+vtk} will be written in the root directory. In visit load the .vtk file and select {\ttfamily subset-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}domains} or {\ttfamily mesh-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}mesh} to see the result.

Here we discuss various checks that can be done to ensure that the execution of both {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+start} and {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+memc} is sound. If the user sees following message \`{} x0 = 0, y0 = 0, z0 = 0; Points representing exosome very small... See section Checking execution status in \href{https://github.com/vipinagrawal25/MeMC/blob/main/README.md}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/vipinagrawal25/\+Me\+MC/blob/main/\+README.\+md}} \`{} printed in the terminal window, the execution of the software is most likely bad.

We provide a utility program {\ttfamily utils/check\+\_\+status.\+py} to check at what stage the execution is failing. Note that the user needs to install \href{https://matplotlib.org/}{\texttt{ matplotlib}}. See instructions \href{https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/}{\texttt{ here}}.

The utility file takes two arguments; 1) {\ttfamily start} or {\ttfamily memc} depending upon which executable has written the output 2) The output file of {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+start} or {\ttfamily exe\+\_\+memc}

Example execution of the script would be;
